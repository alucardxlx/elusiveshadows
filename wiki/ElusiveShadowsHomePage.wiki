==Introduction==

Elusive Shadows is the sole original server of Admin El PlagueO. Who left the community years ago entrusting this server to me. Over the years it became more than was imagined. Now it lies dormant...


==Details==

Elusive Shadows is a semi-dead project. It has evolved and de-evolved over the years. Right now it is in a state of phasing where we are not sure what we want to do with the server. There has been plans to re-implement the Malkuth server structure again. Whether this will happen or not, I am not sure.

As the owner I don't want to keep anyone's hopes up on this project. If it remains it will become either a hybrid or one of several servers dedicated to UO. Several including Age of Darkness - run and owned by Admin Anarch Cassius, Malkuth - Run and owned by myself and with a co-owner now; Valios, also there will be a number of community servers and possible hybrids of the currents to come in this list.

The biggest hold back right now is staffing, my schooling, work, and the fact I am now a developer for Sphere. Which is the server emulation program responsible for all this to be possible. I have earned every step I have made. If anyone is interested in reviving ES. Contact me on http://www.sphereserver.net/ - I am Khaos.
